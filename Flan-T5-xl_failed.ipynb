All four of the boxes had PN: 98D648 - 550 on the box.  When I installed one of the drives it was smaller than the others.  PN on smaller drive's label was 98J146 - 308 and it was called a Barracuda 7200.10.  Larger drives were Barracuda 7200.11 9BX154 - 303 on the drive label.  Returned it and will check the replacement when it arrives.<br /><br />7/3/08 Received replacement drive and it was Barracuda 7200.11 9BX154 - 303. I just purchased this drive and I cannot understand the reports that this drive is noisy. I think the noise must come from the enclosure vibrating and not from the drive.<br /><br />It is so quiet I had to check to be sure it was powered up. I had to listen very carefully to even hear this drive during head seeks.<br /><br />The DisWizard software, which is included, makes disk management and cloning the system so simple.<br /><br />For the price, you cannot find a better hard drive! Server crashed and needed a replacement drive.  I had a raid so I didn't have much of a choice because it is such a small drive.  Very happy this vendor had one in stock.  Lucky. There's not much to say, it was a very easy hardware install (slide it in, tighten the screws, hook up the power and sata cables). The I didn't use the provided DVD since I had a previous version of the Seagate software from a previous drive install. It was a quick setup. I ran a full set of diagnostics - no problem. It's been purring ever since. This was an addition to two other Seagate drives in the system that have 5 and 11 years of trouble free operation. First one I got didn't work at all and returning for a replacement was painless. HD works now and I'm happy w/ it as a second drive.
